# Irreverence  
### This is a collection of repositories and a more unified ground for the game/engine "Irreverence".

* **About Engine and the Tools**
 * This isn't your regular engine. You use external tools to make assets for it. To make games in it, you need to modify the game itself. So there is not really an "engine", you modify the game as deep as you want. No limits, you can easily write a different Renderer or something. Full control.
 * It is written in C and C++. Lua is supported as the scripting language.
 * For Graphics: OpenGL 4.5 (and extensions), DirectX12. This combination is chosen for many reasons, one of them being accessibility. Vulkan is never going to be implemented. 

* **So.. is this a game engine or a game?**
  * It is a game but I am planning to develop the main game to a certain point which then people and I can fork it to make more games. That is a terrible plan but making game engines: fancy and nice interfaces takes annoying amounts of time.

* **What is *Irreverence* the game? What is it inspired by? What is the concept?**  
  * Genre: **Horror**, **survival**, and **first-person shooter**.  
  * Inspiration: '80s horror, sci-fi, action, and political movies. It is also inspired by bands like **Slipknot**, and more. Lastly, it is heavily inspired by games like **Half-Life 2 Beta**, **STALKER**, **FEAR**, and **Cry of Fear**.  
  * The game is not meant to be scaryâ€”no jumpscares or something like that (except maybe one, for the lols). It is supposed to be only **creepy** and **atmospheric**.  
  * Graphics: A mix of modern and PS1 styles: geometry and textures are low-poly, low-res (probably with stylistic dithering); however, lighting and reflections are realistic and detailed.  
  * General Gameplay: the game borrows elements from **STALKER**, **FEAR**, and classics like **Quake**. Player has to follow a campaign while trying to survive, has an inventory to manage and more.
  * Combat: The combat is supposed to be somewhat close to fast-paced but not there yet. Player will be able to slide, jump, lean, vault over obstacles, wall-climb a tad bit and stuff like that. It is a "survival" game, the player needs to preserve himself and his resources by not getting shot. This means surprising the enemy, taking a lot of covers, and especially a lot of movement!
  * Economy: The fear you put into your enemies', that is your currency. Kill an enemy, you have more money; kill an enemy in a cool way, you have even more money. Money will allow you to buy items that help you survive, the economy system isn't supposed to be the main part of the game, it is just a bonus. I am against this but maybe you will be able to buy guns..?
  * Inventory: Convenient, easy, simple... *weight based inventory system*. Player will probably be able to change gear. Two primary, two secondary, one melee weapon equipped at once. If you are above your weight you will be slower, which is terrible for combat. It takes time to drop items (just for the combat), picking up items should be extremely fast but not instant. The inventory is not the main-main part of the game if it makes sense, it is an extremely useful and sometimes an essential tool.
  * NPC: The AI is not supposed to be extremely smart.. only due to the fact that I don't know how to do those things. Half-Life 2 Combine Soldier levels of intelligence probably.

* **Story**
  * This is not really important at the moment, I got some ideas in my head.
